## Introduction

Artificial intelligence can get started with generative A I artificial intelligence or A I. Generative A I, something's wrong. Let's talk about artificial intelligence. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That was weird. Welcome. Artificial intelligence is a subject I've been teaching for years. But in the past, I often encountered this roadblock where people were willing to recognize A I was important but, you know, somewhere else or for someone else, they could agree. It was important for the company or important for that big external project. It just didn't seem relevant to them as individuals. People would often tell me they didn't expect to personally use A I in any significant way in their own day to day work and life. But that belief changed at the end of 2022 chat GPT reaches 100 million users in two months. A I could automate 300 million jobs. It will change the way we think can work. It's coming for our jobs. Here's the 10 roles. AI is likely to replace GP T is banned in Italy over privacy concerns. It's a malevolent ai and should be destroyed. Chad GPT is about to revolutionize the economy. We have never seen this level of interest in A I or this level of anxiety, incredible enthusiasm mixed with equal amounts of apprehension. Where is this all going? What's going to happen next? That's what we're going to cover. This is a short introduction to artificial intelligence or A I. And we'll talk about these latest A I driven tools like chat, GP T, Google Bard dial and others tools we can use to generate new content, whether that's text or images, audio video, computer code. I'm going to show you what these tools are good at what they're not good at and why they're not good at certain things. But to really understand these most recent tools, we do need a little history because they didn't appear out of nowhere. They're the latest in a long evolution of artificial intelligence that goes back decades. So we'll quickly go over that time line and get the background we need. Along the way. We'll explore the most important ideas about A I and a lot of the vocabulary terms like machine learn learning, deep learning neural networks, generative A I will talk about large language models and foundation models and more and what all of it means. But this isn't just about learning a few definitions. It's about recognizing where A I can fit where it can make a difference. So we're not just going to talk about the ways it might impact your company or the projects you're working on, but how it's going to impact you personally because it will, it is already directly or indirectly and it will continue to do so more and more and I get it, you know, this. So let's dive in and we'll begin with a very common question. But it's one of those questions. A lot of people don't want to ask. What exactly is artificial intelligence? What does this term even mean? Is there a basic definition we could learn And from that point on easily say, OK, that is artificial intelligence. But that is not. And as strange as it might sound, the answer is no, there is no simple agreed upon definition that will always let us make that distinction. However, the question, what is artificial intelligence is still an excellent question and it's a great place to begin.
