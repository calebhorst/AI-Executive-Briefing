## Prompts and Prompt Engineering
```
Getting great results from generative A I often comes down to the quality and creativity of the prompts, the questions you're asking or the commands you're giving it. Now, there's a term sometimes called prompt engineering. It can mean different things to different people. What we can just take it as the idea of applying some structure, some formality and thought to our interactions with generative A I in order to steer it towards the results we want. And when we don't get the results, we want how we then interact with the system and how we refine and rephrase those prompts just as a casual example. And i'll intentionally begin with a very boring business use case. Let's say I've been putting off writing an email. So I asked chat GP T to write an email to congratulate my colleague on their 10 year anniversary at the company. And it doesn't, it comes back with some bland generic copy. It's hard to believe a decade has already passed since you joined us. But during that time, blah blah, significant contributions, blah blah inspiration to us all. And it's coming up with this bland inoffensive copy because it's analyzed lots of business communication where this is the kind of writing most people do most of the time. It's not a bad guess. It's not what I wanted. I'd never write this. So, within this same chat, I just say, make it more informal. I don't have to say anything else because it's part of the same chat and chat. GP T is keeping track of previous context. So it recognizes I'm still talking about the previous email. The subject line now becomes woohoo. Congratulations on hitting 10 years with us. It's now swung the pendulum the other way. It's far too enthusiastic for me. There's lots of exclamation marks and I'd never say something like it's not every day you hit the big 10. OK. So let's get more specific and a little bit more creative, rewrite it as if my colleague and I are good friends and we both have a dark sense of humor and make it shorter. Now, it's more like it. The subject line begins, congrats on it. Decade of suffering. And we start with holy ____. Can you believe it? We have phrases like congratulations on reaching this dubious milestone. It even finishes with, here's the 10 more years until one of us finally snaps and runs out of the building screaming. OK. This might not be exactly what IDE write, but it absolutely did what I asked. And it's this idea that with slight changes in the way you ask for things you can get very different results. If you just engage with these tools in an uncreative and predictable fashion, you will get uncreative, predictable results. And some of the most useful ideas to incorporate in your prompts include personas where you can tell a large language model to act as if it's a type of person that can be a job role act as a marketing copywriter act, as a physics professor, act as a financial advisor. It could be specific people or historical figures or fictional characters act as Ada Lovelace and explain the analytical engine. Write this like a script by Quentin Tarantino assume the role of Hermione Granger. But you can also be specific about the audience. Explain this as if I'm 10 years old, right? As if you're talking to a room full of software developers, you can tell it what the desired tone should be and not just formal versus casual but being very specific like my earlier example, right? As if we're good friends and both have a dark sense of humor, you can be specific about the length. Do you want a short email or a long email? Do you want five tweets? Do you want 500 words on something or three paragraphs or two sentences? The more specific and creative you can be with your prompts, the more creative and interesting the result. Now let's, well, let's get chat GP T to write the closing sentence for this clip. Act as a 19 eighties movie trailer announcer and write two sentences to explain. The next clip is about how generative A I works and when it doesn't in the world where A I becomes more pervasive every day, the mysteries of Generative A I continue to baffle and amaze join us for an unforgettable ride as we delve into the fascinating workings of this cutting edge technology and uncover its surprising limitations. That's pretty good.

## Notes
- Achieving great outcomes in generative AI hinges on the quality and creativity of the prompts given to the AI, known as prompt engineering.
- Prompt engineering involves structuring interactions with the AI to guide it toward desired results and refining and rephrasing prompts when necessary.
- Altering prompts creatively can yield vastly different outcomes, demonstrating the importance of engaging with AI tools in creative and specific ways.
- Strategies like assigning personas to the AI (like a job role or specific character), directing the tone and audience, and specifying length in prompts significantly influence the AI's output.
- Specific and creative prompts result in more inventive and engaging outcomes, highlighting the correlation between prompt detail and the AI's response quality.
