## Defining Artificial Intelligence
```
Artificial intelligence is often talked about as this ultra modern cutting edge futuristic area of technology. And OK, it can be, but it does have a long history. I have a few textbooks here about artificial intelligence. This one is 30 years old. This one's 40 years old. This one's nearly 60 years old because this has been a serious field of study since the 19 fifties. But even back then they admitted this term, artificial intelligence is kind of tricky. We might want a simple straight forward definition. We're not going to get one. For example, in this paper on artificial intelligence, which was written in 1958 by Marvin Minsky who was one of the major researchers in the field. He co-founded the A I lab at MIT and i'll summarize just two sentences of this that it isn't useful to lay down an absolute definition for intelligence or intelligent behavior for our goals in trying to design thinking machines are constantly changing. You see the problem with this term, artificial intelligence isn't that the words are difficult. We know what artificial means, we know what intelligence means. The problem is the goal posts keep moving. You see across the entire history of computing. We've always had new goals, new aspirations problems we wanted to solve. But we didn't know how and some of these goals were considered so difficult, they really didn't seem possible without genuine intelligence on the part of the computer. These goals included things. Like, will a computer ever play chess at the level of a grand master? Can a computer ever recognize faces or understand spoken commands now? Sure. We know how to do all of those things now. But what always happened is as soon as anyone figures out how to accomplish a goal, the response then becomes, well, that's great. But that's not really intelligence, is it? The computer isn't actually thinking it's just executing a formula. It's just a computation. There's even a name for this. We call it the A I effect. And a lot of tech we now use every day began as some kind of artificial intelligence research. But as soon as it becomes actually implemented practical and out there in the world, nobody wants to call it A I anymore. There are tasks you can do on your phone that a few years ago would have been considered remarkable, incredible implementations of artificial intelligence. That's just one example. We have facial recognition that so fast I can turn myself into a 3D cartoon in real time. Now, if you'd shown this at an artificial intelligence conference 10 years ago, you would have been the star of the show these days, most people wouldn't call this A I, it's just a cute thing you can do on your phone if you even care. So we're not going to worry about getting to this perfect definition for A I. However, we do need a way to at least broadly categorize, what are the kinds of things we typically call artificial intelligence as opposed to regular conventional computer programming. But we have to be careful because A I has been around so long, not just as an area of research and development, but also in movies and TV, and books and games. We all have ideas and preconceptions about what artificial intelligence is, what it's capable of or what we think it should be capable of. You can't help it. It's just part of the culture. There are cliches about A I that have become so pervasive that everybody just becomes numb to them. I'm going to show you a few of those cliches because some of them are useful and some of them get in the way.

## Notes
- Long History of AI:
  - AI isn't just a modern concept; it dates back to the 1950s and has been a serious field of study for decades.
  - Marvin Minsky's 1958 paper highlights the challenge of defining intelligence for designing thinking machines due to constantly changing goals.

- Shifting Goalposts and the AI Effect:
  - Throughout computing history, achieving goals initially deemed impossible without genuine intelligence became achievable through computation.
  - The AI effect: When goals are achieved, the response often shifts from acknowledging AI to downplaying it as mere computation or formula execution.

- Perception and Implementation of AI:
  - Technologies initially considered remarkable AI implementations eventually become normalized and are no longer categorized as AI.
  - Everyday tasks now achievable on phones (e.g., facial recognition, real-time 3D transformations) were once seen as significant AI accomplishments.

- Challenges in Defining AI:
  - Difficulty in achieving a perfect, universally agreed-upon definition for AI due to its varied implementations and evolving perceptions.
  - The need for broad categorization of what is typically considered AI compared to conventional computer programming.

- Cultural Perceptions and Clichés:
  - AI's portrayal in media (movies, TV, books, games) shapes societal ideas and preconceptions about its capabilities.
  - Some clichés about AI become pervasive in culture, influencing perceptions and potentially hindering understanding or progress in the field.

The text emphasizes AI's extensive history, the challenges in defining it, the shift in perceptions regarding AI achievements, and the influence of cultural clichés on societal understanding of AI capabilities.
