## AI and AGI
```
When artificial intelligence is featured in movies, TV, games books, it's usually a character of some kind, sometimes that A I character has a body, whether humanoid or a machine. Other times the A I is running on some massive computer behind the scenes, but it's typically shown as being capable of complex multi layered conversations similar to and possibly higher than the level of a human. And where it isn't just capable of one or two specific narrow abilities, but it's generally intelligent. These fictional A is can reason they have multiple skills and they're capable of learning new things by themselves. And this idea takes us beyond the term A I and into what's called artificial general intelligence or A G I sometimes called strong A I or full A I. Now let me be clear A G I is still hypothetical. It's theoretical. It only exists in fiction. We don't have a G I yet, we may never have it, but we do have available is a kind of A I sometimes called narrow A I. Now this is often extremely powerful and can outperform a person, but it typically works in one specific narrow ability for example, we have A I right now that could play chess better than anyone in the world. We have other A I. That's wonderful at identifying objects and images. We have A I that can scour massive amounts of data and provide insights about that data. But just because one of these A I programs might be superb at detecting a spam email or be really good at recognizing an abnormal heart rhythm. It doesn't mean that same program can also play chess and compose a sonnet and recommend the next TV show to watch. And that's ok for the most part, what we want is specialized intelligence, narrow intelligence. Because if we're trying to use A I to accomplish or understand something in particular, it's OK if that program is task specific. Now, the latest generation of A I tools like chat GP T and Google Bar. One of the reasons they've made such an impact so quickly is they are more generally applicable than anything we had before where you can use them to accomplish a wider and more flexible set of tasks. For example, you might use chat GP T to help you write a resume, but it isn't just an A I that writes resumes. It's not that narrow, it's capable of much more. You might then paste in some complex computer code and ask chat GP T to explain it to you. You could then ask it to create a packing list for your trip. To Alaska and then to summarize a business article and then write a poem about quantum mechanics. It's very powerful, it's very flexible, but it is still narrow A I and that what it's capable of generating text content in response to direct prompts, chat GP, t isn't capable of reasoning or independent decision making. So despite some Clickbait headline articles, you might see about these new tools and whether we've reached A G I yet the short answer, no, we haven't. You might describe these tools as a step in that direction because they are more generally applicable. But we're still a long way from a GI a little later, I'll show you some specific examples of how easy it is to reach the limitations of what these tools are currently capable of. Now, if you're wondering? OK. So is anybody trying to develop artificial General intelligence? Oh yes, there's billions being invested in it. For example, open A I, the company who make chat GP T their goal, their mission as a company is artificial General intelligence. You find the term A G I everywhere in their own descriptions of what they do and what they're trying to do. Another example, deep mind owned by Google is very clear that their long term aim is also to develop artificial general intelligence or A G I. So yes, there's a lot of activity, effort and investment around this. But even if we don't have a G I right now. We do still have some very impressive A I, so let's talk about one of the ways A I is being implemented today and that's using machine learning.

## Notes
- Fictional Depiction of AI:
  - In movies, TV, games, and books, AI characters are often portrayed as capable of complex, multi-layered conversations and possessing broad intelligence akin to or exceeding human capabilities.
  - This concept extends to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), often referred to as strong AI or full AI, which is theoretical and exists only in fiction.

- Reality of Narrow AI:
  - Current AI available is Narrow AI, specialized in specific tasks, excelling in narrow abilities like playing chess, identifying objects, analyzing data, etc.
  - Each Narrow AI is designed for specific functions and doesn't possess broad, generalized capabilities like reasoning across various tasks.

- Evolution of AI Tools:
  - Latest AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard have a more versatile application range compared to previous AI, allowing for a wider set of tasks but still functioning within the realm of Narrow AI.
  - These tools can perform various tasks like writing resumes, explaining code, creating lists, summarizing articles, and even generating poetry but lack reasoning or independent decision-making.

- Misconceptions about AGI:
  - Despite clickbait articles speculating on AGI, the current AI tools like ChatGPT are steps toward more versatility but remain within the scope of Narrow AI.
  - Companies like OpenAI and DeepMind invest in AGI research, aiming for artificial general intelligence, but it remains a theoretical goal.

- Machine Learning Implementation:
  - AI's current implementation often revolves around machine learning, a technology contributing significantly to the advancements in AI capabilities.

The passage discusses the contrast between fictional depictions of AI with broad intelligence and the reality of Narrow AI, highlighting the limitations and capabilities of current AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard. It also touches upon the aspirations for AGI, emphasizing the current focus on Narrow AI in the practical realm while acknowledging ongoing research and investments in AGI by companies like OpenAI and DeepMind.
