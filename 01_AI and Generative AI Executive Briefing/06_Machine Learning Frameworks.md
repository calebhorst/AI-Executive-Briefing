## Machine Learning Frameworks
```
In any machine learning situation, there's two essential pieces. First, you need data which you have to provide. But you also need this machine learning algorithm that's able to learn from that data. And often people wonder, well, that sounds like the difficult part. So did the software developers in my organization have to write this machine learning algorithm. And no, most organizations don't write and don't need to write machine learning algorithms. You can just find one that's already been written and feed your data into it. It's the same way that if you want a database, you would choose an existing database management system software like oracle or SQL Server. Even Microsoft access, if you want to make your website, you would choose a web framework or a hosted service. So here when you're using machine learning, you typically use an existing machine learning platform or machine learning framework. There's lots of them both commercial and open source. There are cloud based machine learning features available in Microsoft, Azure or Google Cloud or Amazon's Aws or with IBM. And with any of these, you can then pick and choose from a bunch of different machine learning algorithms depending on the data you have and what you're trying to do and this is what's made applied artificial intelligence just blow up in the last few years. It's become so easy to get started when you don't have to build all this background infrastructure from scratch. But even though you don't have to write the algorithms yourself, you have to do some work. You can't just throw all of your corporate data at a machine and expect it to magically make sense of everything for you. Think about it this way, let's say somebody handed me a flash drive with a year's worth of extremely detailed website activity, data information about every single visit. What that person did, what pages they visited, what terms they searched on how long they spent, what they clicked? Did they purchase anything did the order actually go through? Now, this data almost certainly contains information about fraudulent purchases that we might be able to use to help recognize and prevent future fraud. But this same data also contains information about high value customers in a way that we could recognize new ones. And it probably also contains useful information about identifying hacking attempts. It's all in there somewhere. So first and foremost, we have to deeply understand what is it we're looking for right now. What are we trying to train the machine to learn? And the most important part of the entire machine learning process is preparing your data, understanding what it is you're looking for. And then filtering your data cleaning it, labeling it, throwing out the stuff that's not relevant for this particular problem. Because if your data is full of garbage with invalid values, missing values, conflicting information, it doesn't matter how good the machine learning algorithms are as ever in programming garbage in garbage out. If your organization has a team of people working on machine learning projects. This is one of the responsibilities of the data scientists role of transforming the data into something meaningful and usable for machine learning algorithms. And after that, choosing the correct algorithm applying it, configuring it, testing it. That's another part that takes time and attention and very importantly understanding what you're trying to accomplish. Most data scientists would tell you it isn't a single task. It's a process where they'll often experiment with trying several different machine learning algorithms and test them to figure out which algorithm gives the best results for that particular problem with that particular data. And machine learning has been one of the massive successes of A I with widespread adoption across error range of industries and applications. And even this latest generation of A I applications like chat GP T, Google Bar and Dali, they are all types of machine learning. Yes, they're more advanced than just simple classification or regression, but they're built on the same foundations. So let's talk about some more advanced aspects of machine learning.
