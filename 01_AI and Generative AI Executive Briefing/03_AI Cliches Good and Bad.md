## AI Cliches, Good and Bad
```
Artificial intelligence as a subject has a lot of common cliches and preconceptions, the things that everybody kind of knows about this. There's even visual cliches, for example. Have you noticed that in our current culture, artificial intelligence has a color? Apparently we all think A I is blue. Now, if you're thinking Simon, what are you talking about? Let me prove it. I'm about to do an image search for the term artificial intelligence. We'll gather pictures from all over the internet that have been given this title or associated with this idea. There are thousands of images created by countless different artists and designers, but they are strangely consistent. It's as if there's only two ways you're allowed to show A I. You either need a wire frame image of a brain made of nodes, little dots with interconnecting lines. Your other option is a robot but not any robot. It needs to have a white plastic face and for bonus points, exposed head wiring. So let's see. I go to images dot Google dot com and I search on A I and we get node brain node brain white faced robot, white faced robot with exposed head he just keeps going and notice almost everything is blue and this isn't just true for images on the web. You'll find the same thing with book covers and articles and presentations. It's like all the graphic designers had a secret meeting and agreed. Well, A I is blue obviously and OK, I'm poking fun at this, but there is a point when you begin to notice these cliches and the next time you see a book or an article about A I and right there at the top is a big blue image of a robot with a creepy doll face. You think? OK, I've seen this cliche before. What other A I cliches am I about to get? Now? Some cliches can actually be useful. They give us starting points and ideas to talk about, but I find these kinds of images everywhere. It just isn't helpful. It's distracting because they don't represent what we're typically trying to do. I mean, I don't know what you're gonna do next where they error. But if I had to guess two things you're not trying to do. IDE, don't think you're trying to model a human brain. And I don't think you're trying to make a robot. And OK, both of these ideas, brain modeling and robotics are genuine active areas of I I research but it's not what most businesses are focused on. It's not what most businesses or individuals care about. So you won't be getting any more no brain or white faced robot images from me. But I did say there's also useful cliches. So let's touch on perhaps the most common one you find in movies, TV, and novels. And that's the idea of an A I that operates at the level of a person.

## Notes
- Visual Clichés in AI Representation:
  - Observation of a prevalent color association with AI imagery, often depicted in blue hues.
  - Common visual clichés associated with AI: wireframe brain images with nodes and interconnecting lines, white-faced robots with exposed head wiring.

- Consistency in Depiction:
  - Conducting an image search for "artificial intelligence" reveals consistent visuals across different artists and designers, emphasizing the blue-toned brain or white-faced robot representations.
  - Not limited to web images but extends to book covers, articles, and presentations, indicating a widespread trend in visual depiction.

- Critique of Clichés:
  - Acknowledgment that clichés sometimes serve as starting points for discussions but express frustration when these visuals become overly pervasive.
  - Emphasizes that the common clichéd images don't accurately represent the typical objectives of AI pursuits for most businesses or individuals.

- Misrepresentation in Depictions:
  - Highlighting the disconnect between prevalent visual clichés (brain modeling and robotics) and the actual focus of AI research for businesses and individuals.
  - Expresses a commitment to avoiding these clichés and focusing on more relevant representations aligned with real AI pursuits.

- Cinematic Cliché of AI:
  - Discussing the common cinematic portrayal of AI operating at human-level intelligence, a frequent theme in movies, TV shows, and novels.

The passage scrutinizes the consistency in visual clichés associated with AI, expressing dissatisfaction with their misrepresentation of actual AI pursuits for most businesses and individuals. It also highlights the common cinematic theme of AI operating at human-like levels in storytelling media.
