## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
```
What is natural language processing, definition of natural language. The branch of information science fi with natural language, that's technically true. But it's one of those times where the dictionary definition really doesn't help very much natural language processing or N LP is the area of A I that focuses on recognizing, understanding, analyzing even emulating how humans communicate using either speech or written text or both. One example of where N LP is used is with any of the various personal voice assistants. And I don't want to wake up any device you might have but voice assistant like or, or, or when you talk to these devices, you're asking them to do much more than just recognize speech to text. This is not like dictation software where all it needs to do is recognize a stream of individual disconnected words. Now here, the A I needs to parse and understand what it is we're actually talking about and the variety of different ways we might phrase the same thought. The goal is to successfully identify the meaning, the semantic content of our sentence, even if it wasn't well phrased or even a well formed sentence at all. Was it a command? Was it a question? What was the subject? What are the keywords? And this can be a lot trickier than it sounds. For example, I might ask any of these voices assistance. Will I need an umbrella today? That's a simple natural language question. But most of the meaning of it is not being directly stated, it's all under the surface. This question isn't about an umbrella. This question is about the weather. It could be rephrased as get the weather forecast for my current location. Ignore everything except the likelihood of rain, then make a judgment about whether that likelihood of rain is significant enough to matter. But I didn't mention my location. I didn't say weather forecast IDE didn't say chance of precipitation. I just implied all those things and I expected the computer to understand the question behind my question and actually answer that and not only to understand it but to generate a meaningful natural language response back to me, it doesn't look like it's going to rain today. But N LP isn't just for speech. It applies to written text as well. It can be used to analyze and summarize books and articles and web pages. It's used in language translation. It's used for chatbots and virtual assistants and often has multiple uses at the same time. Let's say you're having a video conference call. Well, this area of A I could be used to instantly transcribe what's being said and provide subtitles for it also translate that into other languages on the fly. And when the meeting is finished, write up a natural language, plain English summary of what happened and send it to everybody who wasn't there. And as with any area of A I with N LP, we can have both specific narrower applications of this and more general, wider ones. An example of a more specific usage is sentiment analysis. This is commonly used in situations where you deal with a lot of online comments or reviews or social media posts. Sentiment analysis can scan that text and quickly identify whether those comments are positive or neutral or negative, even make judgments on emotion to identify happy or angry customers and hopefully deal with any major issues before they get out of hand. And for a more general wider application of natural language processing for systems that can do an incredible job of both understanding complex requests from us and generating complex answers back to us. Let's dive into some of the text based generative A I applications that we now have.

## Notes
**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

- **Definition:** Focuses on recognizing, understanding, and emulating human communication through speech or written text.
- **Application:**
  - Utilized in personal voice assistants and various speech-based interfaces.
  - Goes beyond speech-to-text recognition; aims to comprehend the meaning and intent behind sentences with various phrasing.
  - Example: Asking a voice assistant about needing an umbrella involves understanding weather conditions, not just the mention of an umbrella.

- **Versatility and Usage:**
  - Applicable to both spoken and written language.
  - Used for analyzing, summarizing books, articles, web pages, language translation, chatbots, and virtual assistants.
  - Multifunctional: Enables transcription, subtitles, translation during video conference calls, and summarizing meeting discussions afterward.

- **Specific and General Applications:**
  - Specific: Sentiment analysis evaluates online comments, reviews, social media posts to determine positivity, neutrality, or negativity and detect emotions.
  - General: Empowers systems capable of understanding complex requests and generating intricate responses, expanding the realm of text-based generative AI applications.
